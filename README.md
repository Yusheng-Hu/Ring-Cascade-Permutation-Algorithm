**Circle-Permutation-Algorithm** is a transformative generation framework for permutations that shatters the operational bottlenecks of classical combinatorial algorithms. By introducing a **triple-segment memory mirroring topology**, this framework demonstrates that active logic overhead can be structurally decoupled from the $n!$ sequence scale.

This repository is the official C++ implementation of the paper:  
*"Circle Algorithm: An $O((n-1)!)$ Linear-Time Generation Algorithm for Permutations"*

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Complexity Breakthrough**: Reduces the frequency of state-transition decisions to an amortized **$O((n-1)!)$** level, while the majority of permutations are generated via deterministic topological shifts.
- **Extreme Performance**: Achieves a peak throughput of **4.006 Giga-permutations/sec** (on Intel Core i7-8550U), with a Cycles Per Permutation (CPP) of just **0.45**.
- **Optimal Superpermutation**: Provides a universal constructive proof for the Superpermutation problem, yielding sequences that strictly attain the theoretical lower bound $L = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i!$.
- **Stateless Sharding**: Features a mathematically consistent indexing theorem (Theorem 1) that enables efficient **Rank** and **Unrank** operations for massive parallelization.
